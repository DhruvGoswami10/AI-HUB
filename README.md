# AI HUB

Bloomberg-inspired AI intelligence terminal for news, research, and model insights—rendered as a sleek single-page app with a faux-terminal flair.

## Tech Stack

- Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for easy deployment on a droplet
- Local JSON feeds to simulate API-driven data (news, papers, model specs)
- Lightweight client-side search and filtering (e.g., `Ctrl+K` command palette)

## Planned Experience

- **Terminal Bloomberg vibe**: dense panels, neon accents, and soft scanlines to sell the console aesthetic.
- **Live-feeling data**: JSON-backed sections for Latest News, Research Drops, and Model Comparisons, each with real outbound links.
- **Productivity helpers**: global command palette, inline filters/tags, subtle loading states to hint at API calls.

## Progress Log

1. Repo initialized and roadmap documented (this commit).
